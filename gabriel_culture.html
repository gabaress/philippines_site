        <div class="gabtext">
            <p>
              Filipinos hold many traditions and values wherever they go, even when living in a different country. Filipinos are very religious. They tend to have many Christian values because the Philippines is majorly a Catholic nation since the Spanish brought Catholicism over to the Philippines. Filipinos tend to go to church every Sunday, some even holding masses in Tagalog, the national language, in countries abroad where there is a big Filipino community. Filipinos tend to be very family-oriented people. Filipinos always celebrate holidays and spend a lot of their time with their family. They tend to treat distant relatives like close family, even friends or fellow Filipinos. Filipinos abroad treat fellow Filipinos like family too, even if they are just strangers. They tend to invite their neighbors over for dinner, give them cooked dishes if they are celebrating anything, and just generally treat them as their own.

        <div class="gabtext">
            <p>
              Filipinos are very respectful to their elders. They use honorifics to refer to their elders such as 'kuya' and 'ate' when they refer to their older brothers or sisters, 'Tito' and 'tita' when they are referring to uncles and aunties, and 'lolo' and 'Lola' when they are referring to their grandparents or great-grandparents. A lot of these honorifics were adopted from the Spanish language when the Philippines was colonized by Spain for 300 years.

        <div class="gabtext">
            <p>
              Karaoke is a very popular pastime in the Philippines. Walking around the Philippines, at night, you can hear people singing with karaoke machines wherever you go. The reason why it's so popular is because it's very affordable and renting karaoke machines or buying microphones isn't that expensive in the Philippines.
