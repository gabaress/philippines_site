              The Philippines has many different modes of transport throughout the country. Most people in the Philippines use public transport instead of their vehicles to get from place to place due to the heavy traffic in major cities and towns. However, out in the countryside, many people have their cars, bikes, and motorcycles because there is much less traffic there.

            <p>
              In most towns in the Philippines, you can find a certain mode of transport that can not be found in most countries. This is called what we call a tricycle. In many first-world countries, the word 'tricycle' means a bike with stabilizers at the back to help little kids learn how to cycle.  In the Philippines, the word 'tricycle' refers to a vehicle in which there is a little, wheeled carriage that fits multiple passengers inside and is attached to the side of a motorcycle or a bike. These are used to bring people around from place to place. Usually these work like taxis, where there is a driver and you pay the driver to get to where you want to go. These carriages are usually made of recycled parts which makes each carriage unique and colourful.

            <p>
              After World War II, many soldiers left their jeeps in the Philippines because they could not bring them back to their country of origin. With so many leftover jeeps, the Filipinos decided to reuse them as public transport vehicles. Essentially, these jeeps work like buses, where they follow certain routes and people can be collected and dropped at certain stops.  The local people in the Philippines refer to these jeeps as 'jeepneys'. What makes jeepneys unique from normal buses is that jeepneys are open from the back. There is no door. When you see the jeepney pass by and you want to hop onto it, you just walk through the back entrance and sit down, then hop off when you reach your stop. Jeepneys in the Philippines tend to have many different kinds of designs on them. Drivers use spray paint and lights to make their jeepneys stand out. During rush hour, you can occasionally see passengers sitting on top of jeepneys if they are full on the inside.
