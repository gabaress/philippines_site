            <p>
              If you are considering moving to the Philippines, you have to be aware of the standard of living in the country. The standard of living in the Philippines is much cheaper than in the majority of countries. Rent is usually cheap and labor costs are also quite cheap, so if you wanted to build a house there it would be much cheaper than building a house in any first-world country. Average housing prices can range from 3.5 million Philippine Pesos (roughly 58,178.57 euros) for small houses to 10-20 million Philippine Pesos (166,224.47-332,448.95 euros) for bigger houses which is considerably cheaper than houses in Ireland.

              According to a report done by Coram International, UNICEF, there are still many children who do not get to have a full education like most children in first-world countries. 78% of children complete basic education while the number of children not in school is reaching 2.8 million. Fortunately, UNICEF is helping the Filipino government by providing them with support in building new schools and supplying clean water and modern facilities to already built schools across the country.
